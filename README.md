## uoAvox-Client-Development - `Official Release` <div align="Right">Last Updated: 02/03/2024</div>

>**Welcome to uoAvox...**
-   Our primary goal is to modify the server emulator ([RunUO](https://github.com/runuo/runuo)) and the custom client ([ClassicUO](http://www.classicuo.eu/)) in an effort to create a [game engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine) that gamers can use to develop new genres of games while maintaining the same isometric graphic aspect ratio (1:1) as  [Ultima Online](http://www.uo.com/)™.

-   Our client is based off of [ClassicUO](http://www.classicuo.eu/)_v1.0 and has been tailored to the uoAvox project; this client will be the only client compatible with any server created using the uoAvox game engine, due to the modifications made to its source.

-   Each official release of the uoAvox Client will be done through the [uoAvocation](http://www.uoavocation.net/) website and our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ee8gU7w5VV). This repository is recommended for development teams of server owners using our game engine and those who want to use it as a reference for their own projects.

>**Legal Disclaimers...**

-   Attempting to use the uoAvox Client on official Ultima Online™ Shards may get your [Electronic Arts™](http://www.ea.com/) and [Broadsword™](https://www.broadsword.com/) accounts terminated at their discretion; using any custom Ultima Online™ client is against their [Terms of Service Agreement](https://uo.com/faq/).

-   This software is open-source and so you may freely download, modify,  market, and otherwise redistribute it as you see fit. The uoAvox game engine would be nothing if it weren't for the countless developers who spent endless hours volunteering their time for hobbyists like us.
